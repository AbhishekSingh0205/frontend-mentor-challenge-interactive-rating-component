## My process

I start by looking at the designs and imagine the possible HTML layout for everything to be styled in the easiest way (because making changes later when you already have a layout almost done making small changes could couse unexpected behaviors), after that I implement the HTML layout and start adding the styles from the biggest element to the smallest I also tooked the Mobile first approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### Continued development

- Improve my observation skills to notice minor details during the analysis of any design.
- Learn more about the different tools in CSS and HTML to create the same design in different ways.
- Set up the projects, so the have continuous integration
